## ðŸ“œ Introduction

The world has been conquered by insects. Together with a handful of survivors, 
you have built a fortress to defend yourself from their ferocious attacks.
Every night, an ever-increasing swarm of attacks the fortress. Kill them before
they enter the fortress and kill the remaining survivors!

During the day, you can collect resources and upgrade your weapon arsenal to
prepare yourself for the following night. During the attack, you can choose
how/when to use the weapons you have at your disposal. But be careful, everything
has a cost! Manage your resources wisely or you won't be able to stop the insects
tomorrow...
